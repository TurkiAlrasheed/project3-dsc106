# Student Movement Interactive Visualization


This project presents an interactive D3.js-based visualization of student movement and temperature during exams, derived from wearable sensor data. Users can explore how motion intensity, fidgeting behavior, and wrist skin temperature evolve throughout different exams (e.g., Midterms and Finals) by selecting subjects and exam types. A time slider enables playback of patterns over time, revealing fluctuations in physical activity, restlessness, and thermal response during testing periods.

Built using **D3.js** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.
