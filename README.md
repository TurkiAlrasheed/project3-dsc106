# Student Movement Interactive Visualization

This project presents an interactive D3.js-based visualization of student movement during exams, derived from wearable accelerometer data. Users can explore how motion intensity and fidgeting behavior evolve throughout different exams (e.g., Midterms and Finals) by selecting subjects and exam types. A time slider enables playback of movement patterns, revealing fluctuations in physical activity and restlessness during testing periods.

Built using D3.js and deployed with GitHub Pages.

Data sourced from the Wearable Exam Stress Dataset on PhysioNet: https://physionet.org/content/wearable-exam-stress/1.0.0/
