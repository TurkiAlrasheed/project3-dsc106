We chose a smoothed line graph to visualize movement intensity over time because it highlights fluctuations and trends in the data. We considered a 3D graph to show acceleration in the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) dimensions, but found it ineffective, both due to its visual complexity and because <code>D3.js</code> does not support 3D visualizations. A raw 2D line plot was also tested but proved neither visually effective nor appealing.

Plotting all individual student and midterm combinations on a single graph was cluttered and unclear. We resolved this by implementing dropdown menus that allow users to select specific students and exams. Additionally, we used minutes elapsed on the \(x\)-axis instead of timestamps, since exams began at different times. This approach makes the graph more intuitive for users to gauge progression.

To mark fidgets, we overlaid small orange dots on the blue movement line. Orange was selected after testing several colors (e.g., red, green, black), as it provided the best contrast without overpowering the line. Larger dots were avoided to maintain focus on the graph's overall shape.

The interactive design includes dropdowns, a play button that animates the graph over time, a slider for manual control, and a tooltip displaying precise time and intensity values. The foundational path of the line graph is shown in gray, with the blue line and orange fidgets drawn progressively as the slider moves. This provides users with visual context and enhances anticipation during interaction. While we considered enlarging fidgets on hover, we decided against it to avoid visual clutter.

Fidgets are detected by first smoothing the detrended acceleration signal using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise. A rolling average is then calculated to estimate baseline activity. A fidget is identified when the original (unsmoothed) signal exceeds this baseline by a predefined threshold. The algorithm marks start and end indices of these spikes, calculates their durations using the sampling rate, and filters for segments within a target time range. For each valid segment, we record the start time, end time, and peak acceleration, which captures brief, high-intensity motion events indicative of fidgeting.

We chose to display student temperature adjacent to the graph, rather than embedding it within, to avoid visual clutter. Incorporating temperature via line color, background color, or thickness made the plot harder to interpret. Instead, we represented temperature using a stylized hand graphic, reinforcing the idea that data was collected from a wrist sensor. A continuous blue-to-red color gradient effectively communicated temperature intuitively, while true values (in Celsius and Fahrenheit) and mean temperature offered objective detail.

The color range spans from \(26^\circ\mathrm{C}\) to \(38^\circ\mathrm{C}\), which extends slightly beyond the typical skin temperature range of \(30^\circ\mathrm{C}\) to \(34^\circ\mathrm{C}\) to flag abnormal values. Most students stayed within this range, and deviations were easily spotted by the absence or presence of extreme colors. A notable pattern was a sudden temperature drop at the end of each exam, which was caused by students removing their sensors, exposing them to cooler room temperatures. Finally, we included a hue bar with a moving indicator to show the current temperature relative to the range and its progression over time.

Brainstorming meetings helped guide the project's direction, with contributions from each team member. Tasks were divided based on an estimated workload: some members focused on the HTML structure, others on the line plot, and one member developed the hand-based temperature display. Approximately 45 collective hours were spent on the project. The most time-intensive aspects were building the interactive slider and implementing the logic for detecting, displaying, and counting fidgets throughout the exam.
