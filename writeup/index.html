      We chose a smoothed line graph to show the change in movement intensity over time because this type of visual encoding highlights the fluctuations and differences within the data. We also considered using a 3D graph to show movement acceleration in the x, y, and z dimensions, but we found it less effective because it makes it difficult to see these changes, and D3.js does not support 3D visualizations. Another graph we tried was the raw 2D line plot, but this was neither visually effective nor appealing. Plotting all of the individual student and midterm combinations on one graph was also ineffective– we improved this by using dropdowns where users can choose the specific midterm and student. In addition, we calculated the minutes elapsed rather than using the exact timestamp on our x-axis because the exams began on different days and times. We also found this more useful for viewers to see exactly how much time has passed. Furthermore, displaying the fidgets directly on the line plot, as small dots, helps identify exactly where they occur. Since the line is blue, the fidgets are represented as orange dots to create contrast. We tried various colors for the dots, such as red, green, and black, but these colors washed out the line. Larger dots also took too much attention away from the line. For the interactive aspects, we began with the dropdowns to choose specific subjects and exams, and the play button to draw the line graph over time. We added the slider to allow for more user control and a tooltip to help describe the exact time elapsed and movement intensity. The slider also helps calculate the total number of fidgets since the exam started. The foundational line plot is shown in gray before users interact with the play button or time slider. The blue line and orange fidgets are added as the time slider follows the foundational path. We chose to do this because it is more visually appealing and helps users know what to expect when they interact with the graph. Another idea we considered was enlarging the fidgets when they are hovered over, but ultimately decided against it because there is already a lot happening on the graph.

    <p>We are able to detect fidgets by first smoothing the detrended acceleration signal using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise. Then, it computes a rolling average over a fixed time window to estimate baseline activity levels. A fidget is identified when the original (unsmoothed) acceleration exceeds the rolling average by a specified spike threshold, signaling a sudden movement. The algorithm tracks regions where this condition holds, marking the start and end indices of each spike segment. It then calculates the duration of these segments based on the sampling rate and retains only those within a predefined time range. For each valid segment, it records the start time, end time, and peak acceleration, thereby capturing brief, high-intensity motion bursts indicative of fidgeting behavior.</p>

    <p>Displaying student temperature adjacent to the graph was chosen because of the additional information that it provides the viewer without overcomplicating the line plot. Adding temperature within the line plot as color of the line, color of the background, or thickness of the line was avoided because of the increased clutter that they provided to the graph. Representing the temperature using a hand was the design choice as it conveys that the source of the information is a wrist sensor, and because the viewers can instantly associate the hand with the student’s body, grounding the temperature reading in a relatable human form. A continuous color scheme from blue to red, representing cold and hot, respectively, was useful in intuitively representing the temperature of the student at a simple glance, rather than needing the true values. True values, in both Fahrenheit and Celsius, and mean temperature were also included to give objective information on the temperatures of each student. The color gradient ranged from 26 to 38 oC because the typical range for human skin temperature ranges from 30 to 34 oC and having the extra couple degrees on each end would represent a drastic temperature that is very abnormal. Most students stayed within the normal range during their exams, and having this range would inform the reader that they did not reach these extreme levels due to their colors not reaching deep blue or deep red. A noteworthy detail to mention is the drastic drop in temperature at the end of each student’s final exam. Temperatures would drop to very low temperatures because the students would take off their sensors and measure the room temperature, which was much lower than the students’ body temperature. In addition, adding the color hue bar with the line marking the present temperature was essential to providing a visual representation of the temperature of the student compared to the extreme ranges and the movement of the temperature throughout the exam.</p>

    <p>Brainstorming meetings were held that guided the development of the project, with each person having ideas that were implemented, refined, or avoided. An overall workload was estimated and was then split equally among the team members. Separate parts of the project were given to each team member to work on while also having other portions that included all members’ presence to complete. More specifically, members worked on the HTML pages while other members created the line plot, and another member created the hand representation of the temperature throughout each exam. Approximately 45 hours were spent working on the project between all of the group members. Most of the time spent on the project was caused by the creation of the interactive slider that controls which second of the exam is being selected, as well as the functions involved with defining what makes a “fidget”, making this “fidget” on the graph, and counting it throughout the exam. </p>
